## introduction

- analog devices involve quantities having continuous values
> example includes a mercury thermometer where the value does not jump
> rather it increases/decreases continuous range with infinite values in that range
- digital electronics involve quantities having discrete values
>digital thermometer where the value can jump to any value depending on what it touches


## converting analog waveform to digital waveform
- most natural quantities are analog and vary continuously like temperature
- to convert to digital waveform first you could try sampling it at regular time intervals to square waveforms
- then change the decimal to binary
