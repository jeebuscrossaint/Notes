#### analog values

- components in an analog value are controlled by voltage between 0 and maximum voltage provided by power 
- in a circuit we take input and output and then there's ground

#### digital circuits
- for digital circuits the voltage has to represent binary numbers
- a binary digit, bit, is equal to 1 if voltage is HIGH or 0 if the voltage is LOW

but because of noise (spare voltage) how do we translate it to a 1 or 0??
so we make a range where in this area it is a 1 in this area it is a 0 and there is an invalid range

these thresholds or ranges where the voltage can be 1 or 0 or invalid depend on 
- manufacturing Method
- whether the measurement is taken at input or output pin of a chip

## waveform differences

- in a positive going pulse the digital waveform looks like this:

- and in a negative-going pulse the waveform looks like this:

## waveform characteristics
- period
- pulse
- width
- amplitude
