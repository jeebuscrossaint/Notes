## introduction
- divide a system into subsystems
- subsystems in logic design are called:
> switching network:
> - combinational network: `output only depends on current input`
> - sequential network: `output depends on past inputs`

- Logic design: interconnect basic logic (digital) building blocks (gates, flip flops) to perform a specific function
- circuit design: interconnect analog components, such as resistors, diodes, and transistors.
## hierarchy
- system level = switching network
- register level
- gate levels
