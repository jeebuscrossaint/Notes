sum of minterms
![[Pasted image 20240912194234.png]]
basically for sum of minterms u convert all the ones that are output 1s as parameters
as u can see
we got 001 -> 1 011 -> 3 100 -> 4
so the answer would be 1,3,4

and for product of maxterms
tis the same for output of 0s
so 0,2,3,5,7


0s are primed/notted usually using an apostrophe
so if u wanna have the second last one 110 be CsP (canonocail sum of product) it would be ABC'
where C is primed because it is 0


(A+B)*B'*


### completing a truth table

given the formula complete the table,
and when doing the addition treat the + signs as OR gates which basically are 1 detectors if there is a 1 in the parameters the output is a 1
