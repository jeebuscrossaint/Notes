## introduction

`this may or may not be on the test according to dr petrie`

47 in base 10 conversion to binary BCD and hex BCD
changes each digit from base 10 to either base 2 or base 16
well 47 in base 10 is also 47 in base 16 BCD
then also now we convert 47 base 16 BCD to binary BCD
so we split it
`____ ____`
`0100 0111`

## example
now suppose we had 53 base 16 BCD
well into binary it is `0101 0011`
and in base 10 it is also 53
