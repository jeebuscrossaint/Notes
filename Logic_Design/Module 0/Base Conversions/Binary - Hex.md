Similarly from binary to octal, we will group a number but this time in groups of 4 and our headers will be 8 4 2 1
So if we want to convert the number in binary 10101.01
We make the groupings:
| 0001 | 0101 | . | 0100 |
First grouping equals 1 second is equal to 5 and the last is equal to 4 
Giving us **15.4** or in base 10 which btw to convert this hex to base 10 the first grouping is equal to 16 since it is 1 in base 16 and then second group is 5 in base 16 and in base 10 and the radix value is 4 in base 16 but in base 10 equal to 1/4 so in base 10 the number is 21.25
Remember that in base 16 the digits go like this:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
