e stands for some small ahh number like something thats like 10^-19

ok yea so e = 1.60 x 10^-19 C, where C is coulomb

e is also just a count of electrons/protons/general charge
-4e is 4 electrons
+4e is 4 protons

total charge of an object:
Q = (n_p e - n_e e) = e(n_p - n_e)
basically number of protons minus number of elektronz
it must be an integer cant have half an electron

1 micro Coulomb is 1 $\mu C$ = $1 \cdot 10^{-6 }$ C

Though in this class usually we use micro coulomb you have to convert to coloumb

things called conductors
very nice at electricity flow n whatnot
usually metal

insulators bad
basically anything but metal
sucks at electricity

of course electrons repel protons repel but electrons x proton attract

you cant destroy electrons thats pretty obvious

**charging by indunction**

suppose you got some conductor right where electrons are free to move so say its on a glass stand (an insulator) so say initially the conductor is neutral then say you touch it with something that has more electrons than protons so some object that is negatively charged so all the electrons leave the vicinity of being close to this foreign object whilst all the protons go to this object so you can ground the conductor meaning you can take a wire connect it to our conductor and send the fleeing electrons to the ground![[Pasted image 20250120192404.png]]
