so the field is going to the right and it is positive and the charge the particle has is -2 mc

first step draw the forces

so we need to find x y parts of T tension
![[Pasted image 20250128230315.png]]
so we are in equilibrium so everything should sum to zero

the two things in the x direction are Tx and Fex
so the sum of Fx = Tx - Fex (we subtract because clearly Fex is going in the negative direction and Tx is still positive cuz its rightward)

so Fx = Tx - Fex = 0
So therefore Tx = Fex

Fe = Fex of course cuz Fe has no y component
Fe = |q| E <- will be on equation sheet
Tx = 2 x 10^-6 C $\cdot$ 5 x 10^6 N/C
2 part is |q| and 5 part is E
Tx = 10N

so for y direction
Ty we have is positive going up and weight force going down so negative
sum Fy = Ty - w = 0
So Ty = w
W = mg close to earth
Ty = 1kg x 9.81 m / s62
Ty = 9.81 N

so we know Tx = 10 and Ty = 9.81
so theta is tan^-1 (10/9.81)
theta = 45.6


ok calculus time

IMPORTANT AHEAD

ok so basically we had to do a lot of work to find the magnitude and direction of the vector using like different equations but now we can get it with just one

where r hat is = $\Delta x \hat{x} + \Delta y \hat{y}$
delta x and delta y are just change in x and y coordiantes from charge to point

since r hat is the same as $\vec{r}$ over r the formula can become

so change in E so dE = kdq/r^3  $\hat{r}$
so dq is the distance from q to p right

so thats just one dq or some shit
so now we need to integrate to find all dq's on the line? its like midnight idfk
