how to calculate electric force
also called coloumbs law

r is the distance between two points

btw the q1q2 is absolute value because say if one was negative and one was positive how we gonna get negative force which is not possible wtff???
![[Pasted image 20250121085537.png]]
so as we can see all the forces are in the y direction
so $F_{31x}$ = $0N$ BUT $F_31y = -0.90N$ because like when you simplify that monstrous $F_{31}$ you get about 0.90

the MAGNITUDE is 0.90 but the actual COMPONENT is negative in our case

recall that you can move vectors around (slide them around)
but you cannot change their magnitude and direction

we use tangent inverse because of course SOHCAHTOA we have the opposite and adjacent sides here so then the angle is gonna be the arctan of it

anyways so to now actually get the components of the force vector of x and y for $F_{32}$ 
we need to find first $F_{32x}$ which is = to $+F_{32} \sin \theta$ = + $0.36N \sin (63.43)$ = $+0.32N$ 
we used sin of course because it is SOH and our angle was 63.43 and because we are solving for the x component
we use cosine for finding the y component since of course adjacent hypotenuse and we are trying to find the y component 
$F_{32y} = -F_{32} \cos \theta = -0.36N \cos(63.43) = -0.16N$ 

and of course $F_{32}$ is a vector so $\vec{F_{32}} = 0.32N \hat{x} - 0.16\hat{y}$ 
our earlier $\vec{F_{31}}$ = -0.90N since it was only the y direction

interestingly the coloumb law and the gravitational force formula are really similar but G = 6.67 x 10^-11 Nm^2 / kg^2 whereas in Coulombs law k = 8.99x10^9 (Nm^2) / C^2 basically 9 billion vs like a femto number 20 orders of magnitude larger therefore gravity is a weak af force
Coulombs law is also proportional if a point is say doubled in charge and another point tripled in charge total charge is now 6 times greater but if say one point is doubled and another point is halved then its the same total charge and if say the charges are the same but the distance is increased by 3 times (tripled) then force would decrease by 9 times

if one charge quadrupled and distance was tripled and the other charge is the same then the force is 4/3^2 or 4/9 the original

if the distance was halved and one charge was halved but the other is the same the force would change by 2^2/2 or just 2

well now we know how to find the forces affected two charges on each other, but real life is full of effectively infinite charges! how do we find charges on multiple particles at once?

to find the magnitude of total electric force it is this:
$F_n = \sqrt{F_{nx}^2 + F_{ny}^2}$

**note**
idk sometimes like some questions will be like talking about some axis and stuff he usually starts on the x axis (green references c)

to find $\theta$ here we wanna use tangent, of course because TOA we can divide the opposite side by the adjacent side and plug it into inverse tangent to find $\theta$
then subtract it from 360
so theta is about 73.1 so the whole big ol theta is 286.9

suppose we have a positive charge $q_1 = +q$ is at the origin (x = y = 0) and another positive charge of $q2 = +q$ is on the x axis at x = d y = 0

if we approach this from the method earlier the magnitude of electric force on charge 1 due to charge 2 since they are separated by d is 
$\large{F_{12} = \frac{k|q_1q_2|}{r_{12}^2} = \frac{kqq}{d^2} = \frac{kq^2}{d^2}}$

so then something some thing something lowk forgot 
$\vec{F_12} = \frac{kq^2}{r_{21}^3} \hat{r_{21}}$
r21/r12 are of course the distances between the two charges
q is of course the actual charge/value of each point and in our like example they are the same lol

so now we can also multiply by $\hat{r_{12}}$  since that is equal to $-d\hat{x}$ 

so we end up with
$\vec{F_{12}}$ = $-\frac{kq^2}{d^2}\hat{x}$  


ok so this our example
a charge of +4 micro coloumbs ey with a mass of 5kg lies on a horizontal surface with friction. A charge of -2 micro coloumbs is placed 5 centimeteres directly above the charge on the surface

something like this
![[Pasted image 20250121210805.png]]


ok so in our case rn we got like a couple forces we see its ONLY in the y direction so we lookin at something like this

so the total force in the y direction since thats the only direction
$\sum{F_y} = +F_e + F_N - W$
these forces add to zero because it is not accelerating
so basically simple algebra it all equals 0 so subtract F_E from W and boom you got yo answer
btw weight is W and to find weight it is mass times gravity so $W=mg$ and of course m in this case is 5 and g is 9.81 m/s^2

so in our case to actually do the problem 
so we can replace W with mg which in our case is as i just said 5 $\cdot$ 9.81 m/s^2 - $\frac{k \cdot (2 \cdot 10^-6 C) \cdot (4 \cdot 10^-6 C)}{0.05 m}$

all that basically comes out to $F_N = 20.28N$

ok i guess a part b so if the coefficient of static friction between the charge and the surface is 0..75 how much force is needed to begin to move the object  if this force  is applied parallel to the surface? 

$f_{s max} = \mu_s F_N$
so in our case 0.75 times 20.28 so thats equal to $15.21N$ so 15.21 newtons of force is required to move it in our case.

second example

suppose we are given two equal positive charges with the same mass of 1 gram.
one charge is placed on a string and the other charge is placed directly to the right of it when it reaches equilibrium as shown below:

q1 and q2 are 0.15 m away from each other
![[Pasted image 20250121214334.png]]

so we have 3 obvious forces right now we got weight force and tension force and this is goob but basically we also have electric force being enacted upon both charges upon each other.

so right now weight has nothing in the x direction![[Pasted image 20250121214542.png]]

its just in negative y

and since it is in equilibrium rn all the forces equal to 0
so we know right now Fe is just negative x and W is negative y so the real weirdo here is TENSION

so we can go maybe from the right of q and up making a right triangle from the inital point to the tail of the tension vector
so we now have $T_x$ and $T_y$
and for right now since we went to the right tx is positive and so is ty since we went up too
he also gave that theta is 30 degrees which helps a lot so we are gonna of course use sin for tx (opposite hyp) and for ty we gon use cosine (adj hyp) and we dont know what opp or adj or hyp is.

so all we know right now for components are

$F_{e_{x}} = -F_e$
$W_x = 0N$
$T_x = +T\sin(30)$

$F_{e_{y}} = 0N$
$W_y = -W$
$T_y = +T\cos(30)$

so we can apply newtons second law to each direction
$\sum F_x = -F_e + 0N + T\sin(30) = 0_x$
so if u add $F_e$ to both sides you get 
$F_e = T\sin(30) = \frac{kq^2}{r^2}$

now we cant really continue from here because we cant find q because we cant find T but r would of course be 0.15 and k is just coloumb thingy

for y axis
$\sum F_y = 0N - W + T\cos(30) = 0_y = 0$
now realize this
We can make this equal to
$T\cos(30) = W = mg$
since of course you can jus subtract w from both sides of the y axis equation above and therefore that equals mg and we do know what mg is so then
$T = \frac{mg}{\cos(30)}$
we know what mg is 
so we can plug mg/cos30 into the x equation above
so we get
$F_e = \frac{mg}{\cos(30)} \cdot \sin(30) = \frac{kq^2}{r^2}$

now of course sin30 over cos 30 is tan30
so now you just solve for q
so multiply by r^2 and divide by k![[Pasted image 20250121215828.png]]

and so q is equal to $1.19 \cdot 10^{-7} C$

oh yea btw that 0.001 kg is because we are suppsoed to use kilograms and it was originaly 1 gram
