how to calculate electric force
also called coloumbs law

r is the distance between two points

btw the q1q2 is absolute value because say if one was negative and one was positive how we gonna get negative force which is not possible wtff???

so as we can see all the forces are in the y direction
so $F_{31x}$ = $0N$ BUT $F_31y = -0.90N$ because like when you simplify that monstrous $F_{31}$ you get about 0.90

the MAGNITUDE is 0.90 but the actual COMPONENT is negative in our case

recall that you can move vectors around (slide them around)
but you cannot change their magnitude and direction

we use tangent inverse because of course SOHCAHTOA we have the opposite and adjacent sides here so then the angle is gonna be the arctan of it

anyways so to now actually get the components of the force vector of x and y for $F_{32}$ 
we need to find first $F_{32x}$ which is = to $+F_{32} \sin \theta$ = + $0.36N \sin (63.43)$ = $+0.32N$ 
we used sin of course because it is SOH and our angle was 63.43 and because we are solving for the x component
we use cosine for finding the y component since of course adjacent hypotenuse and we are trying to find the y component 
$F_{32y} = -F_{32} \cos \theta = -0.36N \cos(63.43) = -0.16N$ 

and of course $F_{32}$ is a vector so $\vec{F_{32}} = 0.32N \hat{x} - 0.16\hat{y}$ 
our earlier $\vec{F_{31}}$ = -0.90N since it was only the y direction

interestingly the coloumb law and the gravitational force formula are really similar but G = 6.67 x 10^-11 Nm^2 / kg^2 whereas in Coulombs law k = 8.99x10^9 (Nm^2) / C^2 basically 9 billion vs like a femto number 20 orders of magnitude larger therefore gravity is a weak af force
Coulombs law is also proportional if a point is say doubled in charge and another point tripled in charge total charge is now 6 times greater but if say one point is doubled and another point is halved then its the same total charge and if say the charges are the same but the distance is increased by 3 times (tripled) then force would decrease by 9 times

if one charge quadrupled and distance was tripled and the other charge is the same then the force is 4/3^2 or 4/9 the original

if the distance was halved and one charge was halved but the other is the same the force would change by 2^2/2 or just 2
