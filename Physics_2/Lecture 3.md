you need at least two charges for electric force, but single charges dont produce force
electric fields are basically properties of single charges

so how does electric field work
![[Pasted image 20250123202011.png]]

basically these greens are test charges
so we are testing the electric field wit these green charges
the only real charge here is the blue one
test charges are ALWAYS positive
they are also a super small amount of charge because we dont want it to affect the blue one which we are studying

its all $q_0$ because its the same charge being moved to different points, not different charges

so right now $+q$ is just chilling there and basically at different points currently $q_0$ is being pushed away of different amounts

the amount of the field produced by that charge is you take the force between the charge and the test charge
so the amount of the force between +q and any $q_0$ is $k\cdot|+q\cdot q_0|$   divded by the distance btween them squared
basically
$\LARGE{E = \frac{F}{q_0} = (\frac{(\frac{k | q \cdot q_0}{r^2})}{q_0}) = \frac{k |q|}{r^2}}$   

basically its the force of the test charge divided by the test charge

so basically for our case you pick a point any $q_0$ and so you take its distance so basically then thats our $r$ and then you divide that from $k$ times the absolute value of the force of $q$

for a negative charge its basically the same dinglebop

so now the blue charge is negative say![[Pasted image 20250123203546.png]]

but of course the green thingalings are always positive! so they are attracted now
this time the absolute value really matters because you need a positive value for the magnitude of an electric field

again r would be the distance from a point you pick in the field from the charge

the unit is $\frac{N}{C}$ newtons per coloumb

earlier E = f/q0 and F is of course force in newtons and q0 is a charge which is in coloumbs

for positive charges the field poitns away from the charge
for negative charges  the field points toward the charge

first example

so say ![[Pasted image 20250123204608.png]]
we have this situation a particle of charge -2 micro coloumbs at the origin
so this is two separate problemsbtw

so we have one point on the xaxis and another point like in quadrant 1

so lets find the electric field on point 1

so we need to find the MAGNITUDE of the field is and we need to figure out the DIRECTION the field is in

so we will call our first problem related to P1, its field will be called $E_1$ 
so in our case since q is negative we draw a straight line from p1 to q which when we are SUPPOSED TO START from p1 it will just be an arrow on the x axis to q

so we know that electric fields are VECTORS so we need to find the MAGNITUDE of this field so in our case of doing this math that is the DISTANCE from q to p1

which is clearly 0.5 m

so uh yea you just plug that into the formula

$\LARGE{E_1 = \frac{k|q|}{r_1^2}=\frac{(8.99 \cdot 10^9 NM^2/c^2) \cdot (2 \cdot 10^-6 c) }{0.5m^2}}$ 
and in this case the meters squared cancel out and the c squared in k just becomes a c

$\LARGE{E_1 = 7.12 \cdot 10^4 \frac{N}{c}}$ 
![[Pasted image 20250123205634.png]]

so lets now do the second point

so we need to connect the point to the charge but we can see above p2 is like in the air so we need to draw effectively a triangle

so we know the test charge goes TOWARD the point since it has a negative charge
so we need to find the magnitude between the charge and the point we dont really know that rn
![[Pasted image 20250123210712.png]]

basically rn we can just use pythagorean theorum
so its just $r_2^2 = (0.5m)^2 + (0.2m)^2 = 0.29 m^2$

so yea its literally the same as part 1 but now the distance is 0.29m^2

$E_2 = \frac{(8.99 \cdot 10^9 Nm^2/c^2)(2 \cdot 10^-6 c)}{0.29m^2}$
of course the c's in the numerator cancel out to just hve only 1 c again and so do the meters squared

so we know when plugged in a calculator 
$E_2 = 6.13 \cdot 10^4 N/c$


so now lets find the DIRECTIONS of the field

so we when we go down from P2 its negative y of course (going down) and when we go to the right it is positive x 
![[Pasted image 20250123211024.png]]
so we have that green triangle which is us trying to find electric field and we have this new bright orange triangle which was the existing triangle we would have before when creating a straight line to $q$

so we need to find the angle of green theta which we cant know because we dont know the triangle's dimensions but we DO KNOW the orange triangle's theta because we have the dimensions for it, so we can use INVERSE TANGENT to find theta since we have opposite and adjacent sides
![[Pasted image 20250123211320.png]]

so now to find $E_x$ and $E_y$ we can use $\sin$ and $\cos$ 

$E_x$ is positive as we see because it is moving rightward and $E_y$ will be negative because we are moving downward

so $E_x = E \sin \theta = +6.13 \cdot 10^4 N/C \sin(68.20) = +5.70 \cdot 10^4 N/c$
sin of course being opposite hypotenuse

and
$E_y = E \cos \theta = -6.13 \cdot 10^4 N/C \cos(68.20) = -2.28 \cdot 10^4 N/C$

THUS
$\vec{E} = +5.57 \cdot 10^4 N/C \hat{x} -2.28 \cdot 10^4 N/C \hat{y}$

because of course
$\vec{E} = \sum{E} = E_x + E_y$
sum of components


so for our next example we will TWO charges
![[Pasted image 20250123212350.png]]

basically its kinda the same sorta deal you calculate the x parts and the y components for each particle of charge ($q_1$ and $q_2$) and then you add them both

so of course in our case the effects of $q_1$ on P is that P will be going away since q1 is positive

so uh idont feel like writing k over and over again

$E_1 = \frac{k \cdot 1 \cdot 10^-6 c}{0.5m^2}$

of course the c will cancel out and so will the meterse squared i said this already

but anyways we can see here that $E_{1x} = 0$ and $E_{1y} = -E_1$ because this vector only has one component that has value and of course it goes in the negative direction because it is going DOWNARDS on the y axis, the only axis it has value on

and same thing for $q_2$ it has no $E_y$ value and since it is negative charge the particle will be attracted and it is going positive (to the right) because it has no value on the y axis and it is moving RIGHTWARDS on the x axis 

$E_{2x} = +E_2$
and $E_{2y} = 0$

anyways so $E_1$ from earlier is valued at $3.60 \cdot 10^4 N/C$ 

say we quintuple the charge of $q_1$ and double the distance away from P. We know that this will 5 times the numerator's value, and will 4 times the denominators value (the distasnce) because it is of course beign squared so even though doubled it is squeared therefore the new value of $E_1$ would just be $5/4 \cdot E_1$  (completely theoretical)

well thats actually NOT theoretical becasue we can see here that the distance from Q2 to P is TWICE the distance from Q1 to P therefore QUADRUPLING our R like how I just said in the previous paragraph and then we can see that the ABSOLUTE VALUE of Q is 5 TIMES GREATER and therefore 
$E_2 = 5/4 E_1$ 

Therefore $E_2 = 4.50 \cdot 10^4 N/C$
![[Pasted image 20250123214547.png]]

and so now you just add $E_y$ and $E_x$ to get 
$\vec{E} = +4.50 \cdot 10^4 N/C \hat{x} - 3.60 \cdot 10^4 N/C \hat{y}$

so then when we find the MAGNITUDE of the total field at the origin ![[Pasted image 20250123214724.png]]

is our FINAL ANSWER for what the electric field is in our situation

last thing you would figure out is what is the ANGLE of the electric field

**ALWAYS GO FROM THE POSITIVE X AXIS COUNTER CLOCKWISE FOR FINDING ANGLE**

anyways we would just use inverse tangent (adjacent opposite) to find theta
![[Pasted image 20250123215032.png]]

so the orange angle is $38.66$ and the purple angle is therefore that subtracted from 360 so $321.34$

ok new example

![[Pasted image 20250125194856.png]]
so what in this case is you divide the x axis in to three `regions` 
region 1 is left of that first charge, region 2 is in between both, and region 3 is to the right of that second charge.

for a second lets not care about charge 2, focus on charge 1

so in the end what we wanna do is we wanna sketch the charge from each field in each region.

so say we pick an arbitrary point somewhere in region 1
since charge 1 at x=0 is positive whatever point we draw will be goign AWAY from the particle since of course all test charges are positive

we can call this field from charge 1 $\vec{E_1}$
say we put another charge in region 2, this particle will be goign away of course again.
this particle is still under $\vec{E_1}$'s influence

region 3 is the same deal its to the right still just much further away
it is still going away of course.

it is also under $\vec{E_1}$'s influence

so this is what we have right now
![[Pasted image 20250125195957.png]]

ok so lets put charge 2 back and move out charge 1
so lets start in region 3, since charge 2 is negative 2 micro coloumbs so all the test charges will go towards so we can imagine a particle in region 3 moving leftward toward particle 2

another point in region 2 will also be going towards and again region 1 a particle will be going towards particle 2, whos field vector btw is $\vec{E_2}$

so teh question now is where exactly is the total electric field from these two charges equal to zero besides $\infty$ 

a. they need to be going in opposite directions
b. they also need to have the same amount basically $\vec{E_1}$ and $\vec{E_2}$ need to be the same

so there are in fact two places where they are going in opposite directions, region 1 and region 3![[Pasted image 20250125201550.png]]
however theres only one place where it can be zero, so not both $I$ and $III$.

so the other thing is the magnitudes have to be the same

ok so which charge is the biggest charge abs wise
of course particle 1 lol its a whole 5 micro coloumbs compared to negative 2

so in region 1, particle 2's test charge is going to be very lightly influenced, relative to a partcile from region 3 from particle 1

like you can basically just figure this out like a weight lol

basically its really gotta be somewhere close to the one with smaller absolute value so region 3, since particle 1's influence there is really little and particle 2's influence is already little since well it is $\small{little}$ 

so the last thing we need to figure out is where in region 3 is this point where its zero.

so we can pick a random point but we need to figure out where the field is

so we need to pick a spot so that we are in a place where the length of $\vec{E_1}$ is equal to the length of $\vec{E_2}$ 

so we can drop in a variable representing the distance between particle two and our arbitrary point we can call it $r$ for our case.

so right now the distance between arbitrary point and particle two is $r$ 
so our formula right now looks like 
$E_2 = \frac{k|q_2|}{r^2}$ 

btw the distance between particle 1 and particle two is 0.2 m
so the distance between p1 to r is r+0.2m

so 
$E_1 = \frac{k|q_1|}{(r+0.2m)^2}$

so of  course we need to find a point where $E_1 = E_2$ which sounds annoying since we got squares

ok so the k's cancel out of course

so really we have now

$\frac{|q_1|}{(0.2m + r)^2} = \frac{|q_2|}{r2}$

so next you cross multiply
![[Pasted image 20250125204340.png]]

next you can just take the square root
![[Pasted image 20250125204456.png]]

so then you multiply r by both sides and then subtract r so then you factor out an r
![[Pasted image 20250125204549.png]]

and then you divide that whole block next to r by 0.2m
![[Pasted image 20250125204625.png]]

and you end up with

$r = 0.34m$

so the distance between particle 2 and arbitrary p is 0.34m, so the distance from p1 to r is 0.54m
