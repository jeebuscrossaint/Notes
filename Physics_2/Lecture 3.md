you need at least two charges for electric force, but single charges dont produce force
electric fields are basically properties of single charges

so how does electric field work
![[Pasted image 20250123202011.png]]

basically these greens are test charges
so we are testing the electric field wit these green charges
the only real charge here is the blue one
test charges are ALWAYS positive
they are also a super small amount of charge because we dont want it to affect the blue one which we are studying

its all $q_0$ because its the same charge being moved to different points, not different charges

so right now $+q$ is just chilling there and basically at different points currently $q_0$ is being pushed away of different amounts

the amount of the field produced by that charge is you take the force between the charge and the test charge
so the amount of the force between +q and any $q_0$ is $k\cdot|+q\cdot q_0|$   divded by the distance btween them squared
basically
$\LARGE{E = \frac{F}{q_0} = (\frac{(\frac{k | q \cdot q_0}{r^2})}{q_0}) = \frac{k |q|}{r^2}}$   

basically its the force of the test charge divided by the test charge

so basically for our case you pick a point any $q_0$ and so you take its distance so basically then thats our $r$ and then you divide that from $k$ times the absolute value of the force of $q$

for a negative charge its basically the same dinglebop

so now the blue charge is negative say![[Pasted image 20250123203546.png]]

but of course the green thingalings are always positive! so they are attracted now
this time the absolute value really matters because you need a positive value for the magnitude of an electric field

again r would be the distance from a point you pick in the field from the charge

the unit is $\frac{N}{C}$ newtons per coloumb

earlier E = f/q0 and F is of course force in newtons and q0 is a charge which is in coloumbs

for positive charges the field poitns away from the charge
for negative charges  the field points toward the charge

first example

so say ![[Pasted image 20250123204608.png]]
we have this situation a particle of charge -2 micro coloumbs at the origin
so this is two separate problemsbtw

so we have one point on the xaxis and another point like in quadrant 1

so lets find the electric field on point 1

so we need to find the MAGNITUDE of the field is and we need to figure out the DIRECTION the field is in

so we will call our first problem related to P1, its field will be called $E_1$ 
so in our case since q is negative we draw a straight line from p1 to q which when we are SUPPOSED TO START from p1 it will just be an arrow on the x axis to q

so we know that electric fields are VECTORS so we need to find the MAGNITUDE of this field so in our case of doing this math that is the DISTANCE from q to p1

which is clearly 0.5 m

so uh yea you just plug that into the formula

$\LARGE{E_1 = \frac{k|q|}{r_1^2}=\frac{(8.99 \cdot 10^9 NM^2/c^2) \cdot (2 \cdot 10^-6 c) }{0.5m^2}}$ 
and in this case the meters squared cancel out and the c squared in k just becomes a c

$\LARGE{E_1 = 7.12 \cdot 10^4 \frac{N}{c}}$ 
![[Pasted image 20250123205634.png]]

so lets now do the second point

so we need to connect the point to the charge but we can see above p2 is like in the air so we need to draw effectively a triangle

so we know the test charge goes TOWARD the point since it has a negative charge
so we need to find the magnitude between the charge and the point we dont really know that rn
![[Pasted image 20250123210712.png]]

basically rn we can just use pythagorean theorum
so its just $r_2^2 = (0.5m)^2 + (0.2m)^2 = 0.29 m^2$

so yea its literally the same as part 1 but now the distance is 0.29m^2

$E_2 = \frac{(8.99 \cdot 10^9 Nm^2/c^2)(2 \cdot 10^-6 c)}{0.29m^2}$
of course the c's in the numerator cancel out to just hve only 1 c again and so do the meters squared

so we know when plugged in a calculator 
$E_2 = 6.13 \cdot 10^4 N/c$


so now lets find the DIRECTIONS of the field
